              military to steaming around the U.S from port to port, to becoming
              a Full Stack Developer. It has been an epic ride and I wouldn't
              change any of it.

                  exceptional work based on the specs we gave him for each
                  project, but he also gave input on how to make the end product
                  even better and cared about how users would engage with the
                  builds. I will be using Ryan again in the future and would
                  highly recommend his services to anyone.

                  delivered exactly as is outlined. Beyond that, his development

                  recommendation.

                  providing advice and guidance at every step. The work we
                  received from him was top-notch, thoroughly documented, and
